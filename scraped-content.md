- Lesson outlines and activity ideas including photo-copiable worksheets are in the age level separate books: Pebbles, Rocks and Boulders.

- Suitable for a wide variety of ages and ministry contexts.

#### Long Range Resources (Light Curriculum)
If your church is looking for a curriculum that will span a year or more, covering a wide range of themes and topics, a long-range resource might work well.

A subscription-based curriculum offering faithful, creative and effective Bible teaching material for children's and youth ministries.

Lectio for Families is a free daily devotional that helps families to read the Bible and explore faith through conversation and prayer together.

This podcast is a fantastic, children-focussed series focussed on the Advent story. Please note that, while We Wonder is no longer releasing new episodes, previous years' content is still well worth listening to.

Their friends at mainlyMINISTRIES have produced a new Christmas resource for church services and/or children's ministry.

Each year, the Bible Society produces a wonderful, free booklet based on the Christmas story. These are perfect for giving out to participants in children's ministry and outreach programmes, and are available to order from their website.

#### Strandz (Anglican resources)
Strandz, the Anglican Children and Families Ministry hub, also has a great variety of resources curated on their website.

## 6. The Season of Lent

**URL:** https://pcfm.org.nz/the-season-of-lent/
**Page Title:** Lent and Easter - Presbyterian Children and Families Ministry

### Body Text:

#### BIBLE EXPLORE
BIBLE EXPLORE is a home NZ-based resource that includes year-round engagement with the journey throughout Lent (and the whole year) rooted in the lectionary.

#### mainly Ministries Resources
Their friends at mainly Ministries have developed two free resources:
- "Easter - a journey" which helps the whole church prepare for Easter. It could be used within homes or as a great starting point for services online or in person.
- "Easter - around the table" resource from last year that is mainly geared toward at-home use.

#### Scripture Union NZ
A NZ-based resource from their friends at Scripture Union provides a card/devotion for each day of Holy Week.

#### Faithful Families by Traci Smith
They highly recommend Faithful Families: Lent, Easter and Resurrection by Traci Smith (available as a digital download for $11), along with extra resources for families during Lent found on her website.

#### Lego/Duplo Holy Week Journey
A Lego/Duplo journey through Holy Week where you create scenes for each day of the week (e.g., Garden of Gethsemane, Tomb).

#### Cross Craft
A simple but effective cross craft is suggested, to be displayed prominently in your church to help all members of the congregation engage with what the children's ministry is doing. It could also be done at home and displayed in a street-facing window as a visual witness.

#### Jesus Figure Countdown
You could have a Jesus character that is moved every day as a countdown to Holy Week. A simple yet effective way of journeying together through Holy Week, where each day you light a candle and move a Jesus figure closer to the cross.

- ANZAC Day
- Pentecost (5 sessions)

## 9. Reading is Like Chocolate!

**URL:** https://pcfm.org.nz/reading-is-like-chocolate/
**Page Title:** Reading is Like Chocolate! - Presbyterian Children and Families Ministry

### Body Text:
During lockdown, Cheryl Harray, the Southern Presbyterians Children and Families Advisor, wrote a reflection on "Reading and Chocolate," noting that "During lockdown, many of us read more books (and ate more chocolate!)."

It was great to hear from families where story time took on an even more important part in the rhythm of each day, with parents reading picture books to young children and older siblings reading to younger ones.

As an ex-teacher, she encouraged families to make reading a lifetime habit and joy.

The reflection also includes a quote from Australian author Mem Fox: "When I say to a parent, 'Read to a child' I don't want it to sound like medicine. I want it to sound like chocolate."

#### Storypath
Storypath offers a similar resource with picture books through to youth fiction, with books easily accessed on toolbar tabs for Theme, Scripture, and Lectionary links, and includes faith talk questions helpful for all-age reflection after storytime.

#### Woven Newsletter
The page also links to the most recent "Woven" E-News: the Presbyterian Children and Families newsletter for Term 2, 2023, focused on "Connecting and Communicating in Ministry with Children and Families."
