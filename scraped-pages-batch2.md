## PAGE 1: Anchored Baptism & Confirmation Course
**URL:** https://pcfm.org.nz/anchored/
**Page Title:** Anchored Baptism & Confirmation Course

### Body Text

Presbyterian Children and Families Ministry (PCFM) has developed a Confirmation/Baptismal course for years 7-10, wherein ministers can invite their young people to explore issues of faith and provide the opportunity to profess their faith through baptism and/or confirmation/reaffirmation of faith.

The 'ANCHORED' course includes a regional one-night or weekend retreat (led by national and/or Presbytery staff) and a five-session curriculum that follows on from the retreat in the local church context.

For each minister who has one or more young people interested in exploring faith through 'ANCHORED', the commitment would be to attend the regional retreat with the young person/people with at least one chaperone, and then to lead the five sessions with their young people in the weeks following the retreat.

### Curriculum Sessions

**Session 1: God's Story, My Story** - a session exploring the Big Story of God and where we're found in it, including some basic theological topics that invite questions.

**Session 2: Worshipping Together: Word and Sacrament** - a session including a focus on the Centrality of the Word within our worshipping communities and life, as well as exploring the meaning of the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper, with room to discuss the practices around these Sacraments specific to your own local church context.

**Session 3: We Believe: Confessions of the Church and History of the PCANZ** - a session including an exploration of beliefs we hold in common and the faith which we confess, by looking at our church confessions and the meaning behind our PCANZ logo.

**Session 4: This, I Believe: Statements of Faith** - a session which aims to encourage and equip participants in developing a living document of who God is to them. The idea of a "statement of faith" is introduced at the retreat and then expanded upon within the sessions.

**Session 5:** [Content not fully indexed - likely covers living out faith/serving together]

### Hoped Outcomes

Some hopes and outcomes that undergird this course include that young people would be invited to ask questions and explore issues of faith, and that young people would be baptised and/or confirmed/reaffirm their faith.

**URL:** https://pcfm.org.nz/praying-for-children-karakia-mo-nga-tamariki/
**Page Title:** Praying for Children - Karakia mo Nga Tamariki

### Body Text

The page invites people to use the resources of the "Praying for Children" initiative to make space, look around, and ask questions like "What would it take to include children who may be a bit different, or have particular challenges?"

On the back of the bookmark are a list of phrases, one for each day, to insert into the simple prayer and give a focus to your prayer for that day.

#### Sowing Seeds of Love
Stories and notes accompanying each slide are included in the notes section on the slide, as well as in the document above titled "Sowing Seeds of Love Overview."

The music video puts the spotlight on Family Violence. Every child deserves to feel safe in their own home yet family violence is in every community.

"Just hear me, just see me... let me know that I am truly worthy."

We can all do our part to help children belong and be safe.

#### The Blessing
The blessing song based on Numbers took off around the world during Covid-19. This version is sung by children from around the world, including NZ.

#### Sign Language / Inclusion
They encourage teaching some sign language to include people of all ages who are hearing impaired, starting with simple words like Lord, Bless, Family, and Amen, and using them in any worship song.

A book for faith communities produced by the Disability, Spirituality and Faith Network, Aotearoa NZ, 2014 is also referenced.
