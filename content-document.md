"The koru, an ever-present image in all parts of life in Aotearoa, signifies new life and growth. This family of growing and unfurling fronds are rooted in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The three koru stand together representing generations. Each has its own place and together they share relational community. They are held and woven together by the Spirit of God, nurturing each other."

## Page: About
URL: /about/
Route: /about

### Vision
"To see communities of faith inspired to share God's Big Story by engaging authentically with children and families."

### Mission
"To serve the PCANZ through servant leadership, advocacy and resourcing for authentic engagement with children and families, so that they are woven into the fabric/DNA of the church and are able to fully participate."

### What PCFM Does
- "PCFM advocates for children and families so that they are woven into the fabric/DNA of the faith community and have full participation."
- "They encourage, equip, resource and support church leaders, and those who work with children and young people."
- The website is described as "a kete of resources to help churches and families in the important, God-called task of discipling children and young people."
- "The Children and Families Ministry -- a whanau-based ministry -- is a response to the vital roles families have in forming faith in their children and the partnership the gathered church has in supporting them."
- "Children and Families is a ministry of the Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand (PCANZ). The ministry to children and families in the Presbyterian church is supported both by the National Service Team and Regional Presbyteries."

### History

"A ministry to children and their families has always been at the heart of the church. Early settlers to New Zealand brought the practice of Sunday School to the church, along with a passion for teaching the gospel to children and youth, as seen in all-age Sunday School, Children's Clubs, Bible Class, and Presbyterian Church Schools."

"Consistent with its commitment to education, the Presbyterian Church has long been known for its children and youth ministries. Throughout much of the twentieth century, the Sunday School and Bible Class movements were very strong."

(Reference: Graham Redding, *The Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand: A Brief History*, 4 September, 2012, p.13)

"The Kids Friendly initiative was prompted by findings from 2002 AC Nielsen research 'Attracting New Zealanders to spiritual life' and began as a trial project at St. Helier's Presbyterian, Auckland, in 2004, with Jill Kayser and Emily Wotton as the Project Managers. It was established with funding from the Council of World Mission."

"A further pledge of funding from the Presbyterian Savings and Development fund allowed the project to be trialled in a further 8 churches, and to become a national PCANZ project in 2006."

"The Kids Friendly ministry of the PCANZ continued to be led by Jill Kayser as the national Kids Friendly coach until 2017. Over the years, a vision for a church that welcomes, celebrates and nurtures children was also shared by office staff, regional Kids Friendly coaches and champions."

"The start of 2020 saw a new change. After a significant review of all national ministries and staffing, the Mission Resourcing Team was established with new roles of Directors of Children and Families Ministry as part of that team. Continuing to develop from the strong legacy of those who have gone before, the Children and Families Ministry -- a whanau-based ministry -- is a response to the vital roles families have in forming faith in their children and the partnership the gathered church has in supporting them."

"'Kids Friendly' continues as the accreditation process of the Presbyterian Children and Families Ministry. The Kids Friendly process is being reformed; a new tool is currently being developed."

## Page: Anchored (Baptism & Confirmation Course)
URL: /anchored/
Route: /anchored

### Overview
Presbyterian Children and Families Ministry (PCFM) has developed a Confirmation/Baptismal course for years 7-10, wherein ministers can invite their young people to explore issues of faith and provide the opportunity to profess their faith through baptism and/or confirmation/reaffirmation of faith.

### Structure
The 'ANCHORED' course includes a regional one-night or weekend retreat (led by national and/or Presbytery staff) and a five-session curriculum that follows on from the retreat in the local church context. For each minister who has one or more young people interested in exploring faith through 'ANCHORED', the commitment would be to attend the regional retreat with the young person/people with at least one chaperone, and then to lead the five sessions with their young people in the weeks following the retreat.

### Sessions
1. **Session 1: God's Story, My Story** - a session exploring the Big Story of God and where we're found in it, including some basic theological topics that invite questions.
2. **Session 2: Worshipping Together: Word and Sacrament** - a session including a focus on the Centrality of the Word within our worshipping communities and life, as well as exploring the meaning of the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper.
3. **Session 3: We Believe: Confessions of the Church and History of the PCANZ** - a session including an exploration of beliefs we hold in common and the faith which we confess, by looking at church confessions and the meaning behind the PCANZ logo.
4. **Session 4: This, I Believe: Statements of Faith** - a session which aims to encourage and equip participants in developing a living document of who God is to them. The idea of a "statement of faith" is introduced at the retreat and then expanded upon within the sessions.
5. **Session 5: Walking with God: Christian Living** - a session focusing on the "habits" of a disciple; exploring prayer, scripture/devotional life, social justice/service, and vocation.

### Hoped Outcomes
Some hopes and outcomes that undergird this course include that young people would be invited to ask questions and explore issues of faith, and that young people would be baptised and/or confirmed/reaffirm their faith.
